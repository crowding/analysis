Stimulus parameters

A. A single motion pulse, shown as an X-T diagram along the
   elements' centroid. Elements are Gabor-like with a moving carrier
   (visible as the tilt in this diagram) and a fixed envelope. The
   same motion elements are used for all experiments in this report.

B. We varied the directional content of the motion elements by mixing
   two carriers in opposite directions. A direction content of 0 has
   pure counterphase, with equal energy along both directions of
   carrier motion. A direction content of 1 uses only the clockwise
   carrier. The total contrast of counterclockwise and clockwise
   carriers was fixed at 50%.
   
C. Motion elements were constructed of several motion pulses, offset at
   regular intervals in space and time. "Envelope displacement" refers
   to the spatial dimension of the step. The temporal dimension was
   fixed at 100 ms for these experiments.

D. Stimuli comprised several motion elements arranged around a circle,
   with the directions of carrier and envelope motion along its
   circumference.

Effect of direction content at wide and narrow spacing.

A. Example data taken at wide target spacing. We measured the
   proportion of subjects responding clockwise" while varying the
   envelope displacement (horizontal axis) and the carrier direction
   content (colors.) Note that a leftward shift of the psychometric
   function indicates that the observer respond "clockwise" more
   often, so this observer sees more counterclockwise motion when
   clockwise content is added to the carrier. (i.e. repulsion)
   
B. Example data taken at narrow target spacing. The slope of the
   psychometric function decreases, and the effect of the

D. Row 1: Bias as a function of direction content for N
          subjects. Colors indicate spacing (wide or narrow.) Both
          clockwise and counterclockwise carriers were used, but data

   Row 2: Sensitivity as a function of direction content.

A. Example data for three subjects. For NJ, spacing appears to shift
   the psychometric function. For JB, spacing appears to flatten the
   psychometric function without shifting the point of subjective
   equality. For PBM, a combination of the effects is evident.
